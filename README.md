2. This page should looks like this: '
![alt text](https://github.com/Cosxin/Robotic-Resume-Automation/blob/master/AngelList/startPage.jpg)
3. Copy the entire URL of this page to `config.json` File `jobPageUrl` field.
4. Add `jobTitleIncludes` and `jobTitleExcludes` in `config.json`, notice that they are case sensitive so it's better to write ullstack instead of Fullstack. 
5. Add a `selfIntro` in `config.json`, don't leave it empty.
6. Start UiPath, The robot will take care from there.
